Hello! I'm **Ivan Ho**, a first-year PhD at the **University of Cambridge** from **Singapore🇸🇬** supervised by [**Dr. Tobias Grosser**](https://grosser.science/). The thesis of my work has always been about enabling others to be better – which is why I've chosen a research specialization in compilers while leveraging my experience with the GPU. In 2024, I graduated with a **Master of Computing** from the **National University of Singapore**, having researched static analysis of GPU kernels under [**Dr. Chin Wei Ngan**](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~chinwn/) and [**Dr. Manuel Rigger**](https://nus-test.github.io/).

As an educator of computer science, I hope to work towards an industry where engineers are empathetic rather than judgmental, where we encourage each other to learn and build tools to lift each other up.  That is to say, regardless of the prestige that my current institution may hold and bestow, I hope the following will always hold true for me:

"*In the pursuit of great, we shouldn't fail to do good.*"

There was a time when I used to make video games. In 2020, I graduated summa cum laude with a [**Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in Real-Time Interactive Simulation**][sigh] from the **DigiPen Institute of Technology**. While it's very much a hobby these days, there'll always be a game developer in me, so don't be afraid to message me if you want to talk about [game mechanics](https://gmtk.itch.io/platformer-toolkit) or [invisible tutorials](https://theportalwiki.com/wiki/Portal_developer_commentary) or [entity component systems](https://github.com/skypjack/entt) or [radiance cascades](https://mini.gmshaders.com/p/radiance-cascades) or [resonance cascades](https://half-life.fandom.com/wiki/Resonance_Cascade) or [networking models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTH2ZPgYujQ) or...
