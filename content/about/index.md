Want to know what I'm currently working on? You can find that over [here](/now)!

Hello! I'm **Ivan Ho**, a first-year PhD at the **University of Cambridge** from **Singapore🇸🇬** supervised by **Dr. Tobias Grosser**. As an academic, I'm deeply passionate about computer science education and democratizing the secrets of our craft – which is why my research specialization is in compilers and GPU optimizations. In 2024, I graduated with a **Master of Computing** from the **National University of Singapore**, having researched static analysis of GPU kernels under [**Dr. Chin Wei Ngan**](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~chinwn/) and [**Dr. Manual Rigger**](https://nus-test.github.io/).

I do research in compilers targeting GPUs, optimizing your code so you can focus on solving the real problems. I hope to work towards an industry where engineers are empathetic rather than judgmental, where we encourage each other to learn and build tools to lift each other up. 

That is to say, regardless of the prestige that my current institution may hold and bestow, the following should always hold true:

*In the pursuit of great, we shouldn't fail to do good.*

There was a time when I used to make video games. In 2017, I graduated Summa Cum Laude with a **Bachelor's in Computer Science in Real-Time Interactive Simulation** from the **DigiPen Institute of Technology**. While it's very much a hobby these days, there'll always be a game developer in me, so don't be afraid to message me if you want to talk about game mechanics or invisible tutorials or entity component systems or radiance cascades or networking models or...
