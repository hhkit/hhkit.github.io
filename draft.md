# About

I'm Ivan Ho, a first-year PhD at the University of Cambridge from Singapore supervised by Dr. Tobias Grosser. As an academic, I'm deeply passionate about computer science education and democratizing the secrets of our craft -- that's why I've chosen to do research in compilers and GPU optimizations. Previously, I graduated with a Master of Computing from the National University of Singapore in 2023, having researched static program analysis of GPU kernels under Dr. Chin Wei Ngan and Dr. Manual Rigger.

There was a time when I used to make video games. In 2017, I graduated Summa Cum Laude with a Bachelor's in Computer Science in Real-Time Interactive Simulation from the DigiPen Institute of Technology. While it's very much a hobby these days, there'll always be a game developer in me, so don't be afraid to message me if you want to talk about game mechanic design or invisible tutorials or entity component systems or radiance cascades or networking models

Here's what I'm working on [now]!

# Now

I will be at EuroLLVM 2024 in Berlin, presenting our work on further integrating IRDL into the MLIR ecosystem. 

## Soon

I'm looking into compiler optimizations for rendering pipelines. The machine learning world has brought so many new ideas into the graphics realm, and there's no reason other fields shouldn't be able to leverage what they've done. Cooperative matrix and vector operations give shaders the ability to access the tensor cores that have somehow hopped (heh) their way into GPUs these days -- opening the opportunity for new optimizations.

## Beyond

Over the years, the software engineering curriculum has accrued plenty of cruft, and it waterboards students with a deluge of techniques both current and ancient that ends up vastly irrelevant to real-world work and drastically underequips students for their future roles in industry. I hope to drastically simplify the scope of SWE101, and the thesis is as follows: 

> Software engineering is not a coding problem, it is a people problem.
